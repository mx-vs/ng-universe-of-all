                The Vampirian are goliath survivors of a contact with the tainted cursed mists of the Dark

                of Astarian and beyond, they are famous for their thirst for blood and

            <h4>Lumian</h4>
            <p>
                Lumian, in their native tongue Light Incarnate, are beings without a physical
                body, but
                their body is a pure manifestation of the magic Force itself. The whole race
                has aligned
                themselves with the Amber Crystalborn in a meritocratic alliance,
                where
                individuals are given power based on individual achievements.
